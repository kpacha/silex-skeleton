#silex-skeleton

A template for silex-based projects

##Usage

With composer

	$ composer create-project kpacha/silex-skeleton PROJECT_DIR dev-master

And do not keep the `.git` file!

Also, remember to customize your `composer.json` file with the right values for your project.

##What's included?

Just the basics: silex, twig and phpunit (just in `dev`) and the required boilerplate code
